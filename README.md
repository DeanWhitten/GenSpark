**Java Core Trainning**
This is my work from the first 6 weeks of 12 weeks of training at GenSpark for Full-Stack Java Engineering. Each week covered a variety of core Java concepts with projects related to those concepts to practice and demonstrate the understanding of some of that week's concepts.

###### WEEK 1:
**Java Core I -** Primitive Data Types, Predicate Logic, Strings, Sentinel Constructs (Looping), Arrays, Version Control Systems(git/github), Debugging

- [Dragon Cave](https://github.com/DeanWhitten/GenSpark/tree/main/DragonCave "Dragon Cave")
- [Guess the Number](https://github.com/DeanWhitten/GenSpark/tree/main/GuessTheNumber "Guess the Number")

###### WEEK 2:
**Java Core II -** Exceptions, Checked Exceptions, Unchecked Exceptions, User Defined, Exceptions, Unit Testing, JUnit
- *Redo [Dragon Cave](http://github.com/DeanWhitten/GenSpark/tree/main/DragonCave "Dragon Cave") and [Guess the Number](http://github.com/DeanWhitten/GenSpark/tree/main/GuessTheNumber "Guess the Number") and add exceptions*
- *Add unit tests to the projects [Dragon Cave](http://github.com/DeanWhitten/GenSpark/tree/main/DragonCave "Dragon Cave") and [Guess the Number](http://github.com/DeanWhitten/GenSpark/tree/main/GuessTheNumber "Guess the Number")*

###### WEEK 3:
**Java Core III -** Collections, Array List, Linked List, Hash Set, Tree Set, Hash Map, Iterator
- [Hangman](https://github.com/DeanWhitten/GenSpark/tree/main/Hangman "Hangman")

###### WEEK 4:
**Java Core IV -** Object Oriented Programming, Classes, Attributes, Methods, Constructors, Interfaces, Enumerations
- [Humans VS Goblins](https://github.com/DeanWhitten/GenSpark/tree/main/HumansVsGoblins "Humans VS Goblins")

###### WEEK 5:
**Java Core V -** Functional Programming, Functional Interfaces, Streams, Map, Filter, Reduce, Lambda Expressions
- [Hangman Project Functional](https://github.com/DeanWhitten/GenSpark/tree/main/Hangman_Fuctional "Hangman Project Functional")

###### WEEK 6:
**Java Core VI -** IO Files, Reading Files, Writing Files
- Add a GUI to Humans VS Goblins -> [Humans VS Goblins Android](https://github.com/DeanWhitten/GenSpark/tree/main/HumansVsGoblins_Android "Humans VS Goblins Android")
