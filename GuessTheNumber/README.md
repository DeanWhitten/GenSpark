# Guess the Number
A CLI guessing game.

In this game, the console takes in a user's name, generates a random number for the game, and then propmts the user to guess a number. When then the user inputs a valid guess the program then determines if the user's guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game gives the user 6 chances to guess the random number selected at the beginning of the game, if they dont they lose. If the guess is correct they win. Once the game is over the program then asks the user if they would like to play again and depending on user imput the game restarts or either the program exits.
